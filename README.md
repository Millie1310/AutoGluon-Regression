# üß† AutoGluon: Health Activity Insights - Regression & Classification

Welcome! This project explores health and activity data through the power of [AutoGluon](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/index.html), applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques for both **regression** and **classification** tasks.

### Project Highlights:
- **Regression**: Predict daily calories burned based on activity metrics.
- **Classification**: Categorize days as **Weekdays** or **Weekends**, analyzing activity patterns.
